Space Complexity

What is it? Space complexity is the amount of memory space an algorithm uses to execute completely. 
The memory an algorithm uses to solve a problem includes variables, program instructions, and execution. 
These memory types are categorized in Auxiliary Space and Input Space.

Why is it important? Space complexity is important because any organization has a limited amount of resources. 
The memory any algorithm uses to solve a problem, and the time it spends using that memory, must be considered when designing or choosing an algorithm.
