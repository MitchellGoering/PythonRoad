 Time Complexity

What is it? Time complexity is the amount of time an algorithm takes to fully execute, measured by the time it takes to run each statement of code. 

Why is it important? The time it takes an algorithm to solve a problem is must be considered when designing or choosing an algorithm, 
because there may be no benefit to using an algorithm that takes longer than another. 
Time complexity is often weighted higher than space complexity when considering the efficiency of a given algorithm. 
The goal is to use the most efficient algorithm in respect to cost, and time is generally more expensive than space.
